# Enter your manifest.yml.
#
# There are two methods for specifying route maps: hardcoding in manifest.yml or using variables in the vars.yml file
# Hardcode route maps in the manifest:
# routes:
#   - route: app.harness.io
#   - route: temp.harness.io
# Use variables in the vars.yml file:
# routes:
#   - route: ((MY_ROUTE_1))
#   - route: ((MY_ROUTE_2))
#
# Please refer to {https://docs.harness.io} for details about using manifest.yml.

# Define the default name, memory limit, and number of instances.
# You can override variable values such as ((PCF_APP_NAME)), ((APP_MEMORY)), and ((INSTANCES)) in the vars.yml file.
# Use random-route to generate a unique route and avoid name collisions.
